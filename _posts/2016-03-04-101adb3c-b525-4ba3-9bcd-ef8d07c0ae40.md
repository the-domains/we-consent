Consent is the wrong word.  It applies when one is doing something to or on behalf of someone else.  But sexual relations are done _**with**_ another, not to another.

The right words are welcoming, respect and license. 

Is the behavior you are about to perform going to be welcomed by the other person?  Are you going to be welcomed by the other person?

The answer must be yes.  If unsure, then you _**MUST **_stop.

Are you approaching the other person with respect?  That is, with a perspective which assumes that you and they will have repeated interactions after today? "Re" (again) and "spect" (to view) are the foundations on which welcoming behavior is built.

The answer must be yes.  If unsure, then you _**MUST **_stop.

Do you have license to touch the other person?  How do you know? License must be explicitly granted.  License does not stem from any form of entitlement, or status, or situation, or relationship.  License can be withdrawn at any time.  Without license even the most welcoming behavior will be perceived as disrespectful.  So do you have license?

The answer must be yes.  If unsure, then you _**MUST **_stop.

Consent seems like a complicated word.  But it can be simple.

Welcoming, respectful, and with license.  That's consent.
