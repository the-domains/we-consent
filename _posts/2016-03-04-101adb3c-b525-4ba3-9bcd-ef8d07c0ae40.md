CONSENT IS THE WRONG WORD -- NO WONDER ITS CONFUSING
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/133ee866ecc47537f56aac4d21c4626d41b02440.png)

Consent is the wrong word.  It applies when one is doing something to or on behalf of someone else.  But, sexual relations are done _**with**_ someone else -- not to them nor on their behalf.

The right words are welcoming, respect and license.

Is the behavior you are about to perform going to be welcomed by the other person?  Are you going to be welcomed by the other person?

The answer must be yes.  If unsure then you _**MUST **_stop.

Are you approaching the other person with respect?  That is with a perspective which assumes that you and they will have repeated interactions after today? "Re" (again) and "spect" (to view) are the foundations on which welcoming behavior is built.

The answer must be yes.  If unsure then you _**MUST **_stop.

Do you have a license to touch the other person?  How do you know?  Licenses must be explicitly granted.  License does not stem from any form of entitlement, or status, or situation, or relationship.  License can be withdrawn at any time.  Without license even the most welcoming behavior will be perceived as disrespectful.  So do you have a license?

The answer must be yes.  If unsure then you _**MUST **_stop.

Consent seems like a complicated word.  But it can be simple.

Welcoming, respectful, and with license.  That's consent.
